# Comparator coverage matrix

Which torchsky functionality is evaluated against which comparator, and whether it is a
release gate. "Gate" means `TORCHSKY_HARNESS_REQUIRE_GATES=1` makes a missing comparator a
failure (`tests/conftest.py`, `RELEASE_GATE_FILES`); the CANFAR campaign sets it. Exhaustive
domain gates are listed in [releases/0.1.0/gate-matrix.md](releases/0.1.0/gate-matrix.md).

## torchsky 0.5 comparator map

Every torchsky primitive area against the full comparator map ("own API, compared in the harness").
Parity = bounded deterministic gate listed in `scripts/canfar/run_gates.py` (`PARITY_TESTS`);
Performance = throughput and speedup recorded (never gated) by `benchmarks/bench_comparator_perf.py`
(`bench-comparator-perf-gate`, JSON `benchmark_results/comparator_perf*.json`, summary table
"Comparator performance") or an older gate named below. "Oracle" = out-of-process comparator
(`tests/_oracle.py`, NPZ exchange, own interpreter).

### pixwin

`torchsky.sphere.pixwin` computes the T and P windows from the pixel shapes for any nside. healpy
reads the HEALPix tables, which HEALPix documents as exact only for `nside <= 128`; above that T is
extrapolated from nside 128 with a top-hat scaling and P is T times a low-`l` factor
([HEALPix docs](https://healpix.sourceforge.io/html/intro_Pixel_window_functions.htm)). The gate
therefore uses healpy only where its tables are exact, and an independent reference elsewhere:
`tests/_pixwin_reference.py` integrates `int_p Y_lm^*` exactly in azimuth and with Gauss-Legendre in
the ring coordinate for every pixel class (NumPy only; cost `O(lmax^2 nside^2)`, hence the bounded
`lmax`). The reference matches the exact healpy tables to 1e-11 for nside 2-64 (`l <= 4 nside`).

| nside | `l` checked vs reference | torchsky vs reference | healpy vs reference | healpy vs torchsky, T / P, `l <= 4 nside` | test time (reference) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2-128 | `4 nside` (healpy exact) | < 1.4e-13 (via healpy) | < 1.3e-13 | T < 1.3e-13; P ~0.94e-6 (8/nside)^4 (frame term) | < 1 s |
| 256 | 256 / 767 (slow) | 1.2e-14 / 2.8e-14 | 2.4e-6 / 7.3e-6 | 7.3e-6 / 7.0e-6 | 8 s / 68 s |
| 512 | 128 | 1.6e-14 | 1.3e-6 | 1.06e-5 / 1.03e-5 | 7 s |
| 1024 | 64 (slow) | 1.3e-14 | 1.3e-6 | 1.21e-5 / 1.20e-5 | 7 s |
| 2048 | 64 (slow) | 2.7e-14 | 1.3e-6 | 1.28e-5 / 1.28e-5 | 26 s |

Known discrepancy (informational, not a torchsky defect): the healpy tables for nside >= 256 are high
by a smooth `~4e-6 (l/nside)^2` relative term plus irregular low-`l` errors (nside 256, `l = 1`: +4.0e-7,
confirmed with a healpy-only boundary-integral check of `w_1`). Rows are appended to
`benchmark_results/pixwin_healpy_deviation.jsonl`; the test bounds them at 2e-5 so a change in the
tables is noticed. Draft upstream report: [healpix-pixwin-upstream-issue.md](healpix-pixwin-upstream-issue.md).

P frame term: torchsky parallel-transports the polarization frame between the two points of each pair
(kernel `d^l_22`); the HEALPix exact tables differ by ~0.94e-6 (8/nside)^4 (2.4e-4 at nside 2, 1.4e-11
at 128), bounded in the gate by 1.2e-6 (8/nside)^4 + 1e-11. No independent P reference exists for
nside >= 256: a single-pixel frame differs from pairwise transport by `O(Omega^2)` (estimated ~1e-10 at nside 256),
above the 1e-11 target, so P there is covered only by the informational healpy comparison.

Runtime: the reference times above are on one core; torchsky computes the nside 1024/2048 moments once
(about 17 s / 60 s) and caches them under `~/.cache/torchsky/pixwin`. Non-slow cases take about 20 s in total.

STILTS modes and torchsky equivalents (`tests/test_stilts_parity.py`). Parity means equal multisets of matched row tuples
(`-1` = absent side); the only exclusion is a pair whose separation is within 1e-6 arcsec of its threshold, dropped from both sides together
with the tuples that involve its rows (bounded by `max(2, 1e-5 n)`).

| STILTS | torchsky | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `tmatch2 matcher=sky find=best1 / best2 / all` | `crossmatch_sky(find="best1" / "best2" / "all")` (`"best"` is a legacy alias of `best1`) | tuple-equal |
| `tmatch2 find=best` | `crossmatch_sky(find="mutual")` (exactly `best1 & best2`); `"symmetric"` is a greedy one-to-one assignment, deliberately not STILTS | tuple-equal, every join |
| `tmatch2 join=1and2 / 1or2 / all1 / all2 / 1not2 / 2not1` | `join_rows(result, n1, n2, join)` | tuple-equal for every find |
| `tskymatch2` | same as `matcher=sky` | tuple-equal |
| `tmatch2 matcher=skyerr` (separation <= err1 + err2) | `left_err_arcsec=`, `right_err_arcsec=` (per row, both sides) | tuple-equal, `find=all`, every join; real Gaia x 2MASS and 2MASS x AllWISE (errors 10x the catalogue values) |
| `tmatch2 matcher=exact` | `crossmatch_exact` | tuple-equal for `find=all` and joins; for `best*` only matched row counts (STILTS' choice among equal scores is unspecified, torchsky takes the lowest rows) |
| `tmatch1 matcher=sky action=identify` | `crossmatch_self(group=True)` | same partition and group sizes (ids not compared), full Gaia cone |
| `tmatchn multimode=pairs` | `crossmatch_many(mode="pairs", reference=0)`: each reference row takes its `best1` partner per catalogue (non-exclusive), then unreferenced rows alone | tuple-equal, synthetic and real Gaia x 2MASS x AllWISE |
| `tmatchn multimode=group` | `crossmatch_many(mode="group")` | same partition and group sizes (STILTS keeps an arbitrary member per catalogue, so representatives are not compared) |

Intentional differences, deliberately not tested against STILTS:

- `distance_tol` is a `|d1 - d2| <= tol` cut on top of the sky test; STILTS `sky3d` uses a Euclidean 3-d metric.
- `skyellipse` is not provided.
- Ranking (`best*`) always uses plain separation; STILTS `skyerr` ranks by an error-normalised score, so `find=best*` with errors is not compared.
- `matcher=sky3d`, `1d/2d/3d` matchers are not provided.

AstroDrizzle installability (checked with CPython 3.13, NumPy 2.5, macOS arm64, 2026-11):
`starlink-pyast 4.2.0` and `drizzlepac 3.11.0` install from wheels (and drizzlepac's `cdriz` runs on 3.13).

Deferred to 0.6/0.7 (global solvers): SCAMP-like global astrometric/photometric fits and solve-field pipelines.
Only the presence gates (`test_external_tools_required.py`) remain.
