`torchsky` is a **high-performance, torch-native astronomy stack** for
survey-scale coordinates, spherical geometry, catalog indexing, mapmaking,
observation operators, and joint modelling of sky observations.

FITS image and table I/O is provided by the focused
[`torchfits`](https://github.com/astroai/torchfits) package. The boundary is
intentional: `torchfits` loads tensors and metadata; `torchsky` performs
sky-domain computation without embedding a second FITS/CFITSIO engine.
The supported integration baseline is `torchfits 1.0.0` or newer.
For one migration release, torchsky keeps thin import aliases for the public
torchfits cache, table, I/O, and dataset surfaces.

## Key Features

- 🌌 **Torch-Native WCS**: FITS-WCS transforms (`TAN`, `SIN`, `ARC`, `AIT`, etc.) and polynomial distortions (`SIP`, `TPV`, `TNX`, `ZPX`) running directly on CPU, CUDA, and MPS.
- 🌐 **Spherical Geometry & HEALPix**: Vectorized HEALPix primitives, Spherical Polygons, Multi-Order Coverage (MOC) maps, and high-performance Spherical Harmonic Transforms (SHT).
- 🗺️ **Scalable Mapmaking**: Area-aware coadds, spectral-cube stacking, matrix-free observation operator bundles, and bounded-memory execution.
- 🔭 **Survey-Scale Catalog Geometry**: Tensor-native crossmatch and spherical indexing primitives designed for candidate pruning and chunked execution.
- 🧠 **Continuous Field Models**: Experimental continuous spectral neural fields (\(F_\theta(\mathrm{RA}, \mathrm{Dec}, \lambda)\)) for implicit forward modeling.
- 🔌 **Explicit I/O Boundary**: Tensor/header/table-batch interchange with `torchfits` and other readers.

## Performance Highlights

`torchsky` performance claims cover only torchsky-owned computation:

- **WCS transforms**: tensor-native forward, inverse, Jacobian, spectral/time,
  and TAB paths with focused parity and scale benchmarks.
- **Sphere/HEALPix**: vectorized pixel, region, sparse-map, and harmonic
  primitives with upstream comparator gates.
- **Map/catalog workflows**: end-to-end throughput, peak memory, candidate
  reduction, exact-adjoint checks, and science-error metrics are the priority.

FITS image/table throughput is measured and documented in `torchfits`.

For detailed benchmarks and methodology, see the [Benchmarks Guide](docs/benchmarks.md).

## Installation

Install the pre-built wheels from PyPI:

```bash
pip install torchsky
```

Package metadata supports Python `>=3.12`, PyTorch `>=2.13`, and torchfits
`>=1.0.0` without upper caps. Native wheels still fail closed on a mismatched
compiled PyTorch ABI; build from source against a newer supported runtime when
needed. Install `torchfits` separately when a workflow reads or writes
FITS files:

```bash
pip install torchsky torchfits
```

The integration baseline is `torchfits 1.0.0` or newer. Dataset
classes are provided by `torchfits.data`; torchsky retains its own compatibility
aliases for older downstream callers.

### Optional Extras

- **`viz`**: Browser sky viewer
  ```bash
  pip install "torchsky[viz]"
  ```
- **`map`**: Extended mapmaking tools (e.g. SVO filter profiles)
  ```bash
  pip install "torchsky[map]"
  ```
- **`bench-all`**: All comparator libraries for testing and parity benchmarks
  ```bash
  pip install "torchsky[bench-all]"
  ```

## Quick Start

### 1. Load Data With torchfits, Compute With torchsky
```python
import torchfits
from torchsky.wcs import WCS

# File I/O belongs to torchfits.
data, header = torchfits.read(
    "science.fits",
    hdu="auto",
    device="cuda",
    return_header=True,
)

# Sky-coordinate computation belongs to torchsky.
wcs = WCS(header)
ra, dec = wcs.pixel_to_world(x, y)
```

### 2. Stream Catalog Batches
```python
# torchfits owns FITS table projection and predicate pushdown.
for batch in torchfits.table.scan(
    "catalog.fits",
    hdu=1,
    columns=["RA", "DEC", "MAG_G"],
    where="MAG_G < 20",
    batch_size=100_000,
):
    process_catalog_batch(batch)
```

### 3. HEALPix Operations
```python
import torch
import torchsky.sphere as sphere

lon = torch.tensor([10.0, 42.0])
lat = torch.tensor([-1.0, 5.0])

# Coordinate to HEALPix pixel mapping
pix = sphere.ang2pix(1024, lon, lat, lonlat=True, nest=True)
lon2, lat2 = sphere.pix2ang(1024, pix, lonlat=True, nest=True)
```

## Contributor Setup

Contributors should use `pixi` for environment management:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sfabbro/torchsky.git
cd torchsky
pixi install
pixi run dev            # Rebuild native extensions
pixi run verify         # Verify torchsky import smoke
```

### Common Developer Commands
- Run test suite: `pixi run test`
- Fast syntax/lint check (git pre-push hook): `pixi run preflight-push`
- Typecheck: `pixi run typecheck`
- Optional local copy of GitHub `build-test`: `pixi run ci-local`
